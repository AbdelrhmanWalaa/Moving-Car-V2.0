# Moving-Car-V2.0
This project involves developing a robot using four motors, two buttons, and four LEDs, with the control system implemented on a Tiva C board.
The Tiva C board utilizes ARM processors, enabling precise control and efficient programming. The robot is designed to move in a continuous
rectangular path, showcasing the programmer's skills in controlling the robot's movements and designing an effective control system. The four 
motors provide the necessary propulsion for the robot, while the two buttons allow for user interaction and control. Additionally, the four LEDs 
can be utilized for status indication or visual feedback. Overall, this project demonstrates the programmer's proficiency in programming robotic 
systems, utilizing ARM processors, and implementing a control system that enables precise movements and efficient operation
